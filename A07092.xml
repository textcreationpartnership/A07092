            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Chriſt as he was man, was in Iury, and Galile. As he was God, he is in euery place, and contynueth, not able by any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to be circumſcribed. Yf when he lay wrapte in ſwadeling clothes in the manger, his diuinitie was enwrapped by the nature of his humanitie, then ſhall his diuinitie, that is vncircumſcriptible, be circumſcribed in a coloured image, but yf his diuinitie was not enwrapped there, in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, nor can his diuinitie be circumſcribed here in the image.

And receauing playnly, and ſimply, all thinges that are delyuered of the church, and beholding pictures or images, they conceaue nothing in their minde, but that which is ſignified by them.

In the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne tyme we will beleaue the ordinaunces of the Catholique church, and boldly affirme that as man conſiſting of body and ſoule,<note place="margin">An image of man may be paynted although the ſoule ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be expreſſed.

Nor is it impietie to thincke vpon, or behold the ſhape of a man without a ſoule, but the diuinity of Chriſt can not be ſeparated from his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitye. Nether is it lawfull to imagine an humanitye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diuinitie leſt we fall into the hereſy of Neſtorius.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue that he varieth farre from all good reaſon, aſke him firſt (good readers) whether our ſauiour Chriſt died not for vs, as man, and whether he gaue not vp the ghoſt, and lay in the gaue as ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?<note place="margin">The ſoule of Chriſt ſeuered from his bodie at his death.</note> and if he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe it, (as he muſt) yf he be a Chriſten man, then aſke him whether the ſoule of Chriſt was not ſeuered at that tyme from the bodie, and yf he acknowledge it, then aſke him whether it be impietie for vs to thincke that the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le of Chriſt was ſeuered from his body?

Furder out of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> you may note two thinges, one is, that the Apoſtles left not all thinges in writing that they would haue obſerued of the faithful.

            <p>As for the twoe iudges of controuerſies, which maſter Calf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill apoynteth, <hi>the woord, and the ſpirite,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fol. 22. a</note> let vs (embracing the woorde and honouring the ſpirite) inquire of his wiſdome, howe the woord and the ſpirite can be iudges of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies?

The woorde, that is, the bare letter of the Bible (as hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes take it) written in incke and paper, conſidered as it lieth, nor reade, nor pronunced of any man, is deafe, and not able to proue it ſelfe to be the worde of God, and holie ſcripture of Chriſt. Yf one ſhould require the beſt rabby, and profoundeſt maſter amonge al the proteſtants, that exacte proufes out of ſcripture only, for matters in controuerſie, to proue and iuſtifie out of ſcripture, that this woorde, (which they crake and brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of) is the woorde of God, he would neuer do it, ſo long as he liueth. Al his refuge muſt be, to the catholick church, that hath adiudged, and declared this be the ſcripture, and woorde of God. VVherfore ſeing it hath thoſe defectes, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be iudg of matters in controuerſie in the church, eſpeciallie, ſeing al our contention, debate, and controuerſie is, of the ſenſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of ſcripture, which they receaued of the catholiques.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Catholiques ſay: This is the true meaning

of this place of ſcripture, and the heretickes for theyr part denie it, and ſay: Nay: This is this the true meaning of this place of ſcripture, and ſo conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſtoutely aboute it, howe ſhall the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be iudge, and decide this controuerſie? It hath no tongue to ſpeake and geue ſentence. Shall we conferre place to place, and ſo trie out the truth? That is a way of greater contention: For when other places be alleaged, the Catholiques may ſay: This is the right ſenſe of that ſcripture. And the heretikes denie it, and ſo procede infinitely in contention.

            <p>Baptiſme by the very nature of the ſacrament, is a full, perfet, and ſufficient cauſe, wherby the infante is made from the childe of wrathe, the childe of God, without hauing any propre faith of his owne, or godly motion to haue the ſacrament. VVe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taught ſo of the ſigne of the croſſe, that it is able to make euell men good, without they haue godly inwarde motions with faith, hope, and charitie.

Yf it might haue pleaſed the worſhippe of this profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de clearcke, to haue looked vpon the prophete, he might haue ſeene, that Tau in that place, made not euel people in the nature of an efficient and ſufficient perfecte cauſe, to be good, but was ſigned in good folkes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heades, becauſe they were good before. And notwithſtanding there is no mention made in that place of the prophet that the ſigne of the Croſſe (figured by Tau) wrought any godlynes at all in mennes hartes, but was onely commaunded to be ſigned in their foreheades that were good before, yet for as much as it doth continuallie ſet before our eies the memorie of Chriſte, that died vpon the croſſe, it worketh in all heartes a diſpoſition of grace, and as the ſkye dothe, make vs conſider Gods glorie, and all his workes. And wheras God gaue, when <hi>Iulianus</hi> was feared with ſpirites ſuch force to the ſigne of the croſſe, that the euell ſpirites at the fighte therof departed in haſte, and he might haue had good occaſion to forſake his Apoſtaſie if any grace in the worlde might haue taken place in him, it geueth vs to vnderſtande that albeit <hi>the ſpirite of life and liuely faithe is not inſpired, as ſoone as a croſſe is figured,</hi> yet is the croſſe of Chriſte, an heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly marke, and will worke the effectes of gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce in vs, if we be otherwiſe apte and meete veſſells to receaue it.</p>
            <p>VVhere he ſaieth in his ſeconde reaſon, <hi>that the ſigne of the croſſe is not ſufficient to diſcerne the good frome the badd, the
<pb facs="tcp:7399:47"/>
faithfull from the infidells,</hi> I will firſt examine the ſufficiencie of this marke Tau, and ſee howe his reaſon hangeth. That Tau imprinted in the foreheades of the people in Hieruſalem was ſufficient to diſcerne the good from the badd, I truſt M. Calf. will not be ſo raſhe as to deny the ſcripture. God gaue it for a ſufficient ſigne at that time to the angell that ſhould ſtrike the citie, to knowe the good from the badd: if it was not ſufficient, then God that tooke it to be ſufficient, was both deceaued him ſelfe, and alſo deceaued the angell. VVheruppon it followeth that the angell ſtroke with the plague as many good as badd. Yf M. Calfs. diſcretion be ſuch that he will driue vs to confeſſe, ſpite of our teathe, that as the ſigne of Tau, at that time in Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem was a ſufficient marke to diſcerne the good frome the badd, euen ſo that ſame ſigne of Tau muſt be taken for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſigne, to knowe the good frome the badd, at all tymes, in all places, amonge all nations, wheras the ſcripture talketh but of the ſufficiencie of the ſigne, at that ſpeciall tyme, in that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall place, amonge that ſpeciall people, I muſt be ſo bold as tell M. Calf. that he muſt haue a bell rounge at his eares, to wake him out of his drowſie dreame, that he may learne, that we vſe not to allowe argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, from particulars to generalls, nor him ſelfe neither when he is fullie awaked. Yf he do, aſke him howe this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t holdethe? M. Calfhill is apointed to reade in Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, ergo he muſt reade, at all tymes, in all places of the worlde: and with all, deſire him to conferre his owne follie with this, and ſee whether it be not like. I will not preſſe him yet with the doctours that take the ſigne Tau mentioned there to be the ſigne of the croſſe. Let it remayne as it is, to be but the ſigne of Tau. VVill he graunte that as the ſigne of Tau was ſufficient at that time, to diſcerne the good and badd in Hieruſalem, euen ſo that it being marked in mennes foreheades ſhoul be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſigne to knowe the good? Yf not, I muſt knowe why. His anſwere can be no other (if he anſwere wiſely) but that it was a ſufficient ſigne then, at that tyme, place, and amonge that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe God ſo apointed it, and that it is not a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſigne in all other places of the worlde to knowe the good, becauſe it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7399:47"/>
is apointed ſo no where by God. Yf he anſwere thus, as of force he muſte, then hath he anſwered fullie for me, why the croſſe, (meant by Tau (is no ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſigne to knowe the good, becauſe God no where ſo apointed it. For the which I thancke him, and ſignifie with all, that it is a ſufficient ſigne to knowe the bad in all places, in all ages, amonges all nations, if they do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it. For they may well be called <hi>inimici crucis Chriſti,</hi>

            <p>As for the dependence and ſequele of his argument, it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth much after this ſort.

The laſt argument is ſo fooliſhe that I maruell much that euer M. Calf. would ſuffer it to paſſe his penne. It hathe neither rime nor reaſon, nor mode, nor figure, nor faith, nor truthe. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument runneth thus: <hi>The ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of God were ſealed which Tau, but many more then be good haue the ſine of Tau, ergo the ſeale that is ſpoken of in this place, is not the ſigne of Tau.</hi> Doth not this concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> followe as well out of yower premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as that the ſigne of Tau is not the ſigne of the croſſe? looke well vpon it, and yow ſhall finde them all one.

               <hi>diſciples,</hi> one reaſon which you bringe, <hi>is becauſe Euſebius ſaieth, the regeſter of 72. diſciples is founde in no place,</hi> An other, <hi>that Hieronimus Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nadius, and Iſidorus neuer made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which had bene a greate ouerſight, if his auncientie had ben ſuch as I pretend.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mart. M.

And if he had, yet doth it make nothing for youer purpoſe. For <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heme declareth that he gathered his hiſtorie out of diuerſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s workes, wich were confuſely written, ſome in this cuntrey, ſo me in that, and thought that he ſhould ſufficiently pleaſe, and gratifie his proſteritie, if he gathered together and regeſtred in order, the ſucceſſours of the cheifeſt Apoſtles of our ſauiour Chriſte in the moſte famous churches, if he did not ſhewe forth all. VVherby it is playne that albeit he compiled his ſtorye out of diuerſe Chronicles, yet he had not all the writinges, all the monumentes, all the Chronicles of all men, and all cuntries, and all thinges that were written and done in all ages, to his tyme, fithens Chriſte was incarnate. Many thinges might righte well eſcape his handes, and paſſe his knowledg as well appeareth by his wordes rehearſed before. To the ſeconde I anſwer in like manner, that albeit S. Hierome, <hi>Gennadius,</hi> and <hi>Iſidorus</hi> made boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7399:55"/>
of Eccleſiaſticall writers, yet this might paſſe their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and yet no ouerſighte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. For it is not poſsible for euery man to ſee euery thing, nor to haue information, or by mouth or by monument of all that was done before, ſearche he neuer ſo narrowly. Many bookes and monumentes of the fathers are brought to light nowe, that then were hidden, and many hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nowe that then were knowen, as all that be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the eccleſiaſticall hiſtories may righte well ſee. VVherfor it is a childiſh parte of you M. Calf. to deny ſo auncient an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and inferre vpon the authoritie of <hi>Euſebius</hi> and S. Hierome and others negatiuely, as (if you inferr any thinge againſt the forſaide authour) you muſte of neceſsitie inferre this, <hi>Euſebius ſaieth the regeſter of the 72. diſciples is founde in non place, ergo Martialis was none of the 72. diſciples:</hi> and ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there were no ſuch diſciples. <hi>S.

               <hi>Proba me Deus &amp; ſcito cor meum, praying, ſinging and ſaying: Trye me (o God) and knowe my hearte.

            <p>S.

But the teaching of ſome what doth not alwayes make a thing better. He that teacheth nothing, is ſome tymes better than he that teacheth ſome what, as the ignorant that holdeth his peace is better than the proteſtant that teacheth hereſie. That which we teache, is that as a naked and diuels faith auayleth nothing, vnleſſe it be clothed with charitie, ſo the bare figure of the croſſe, ordinarily profiteth nothing vnleſſe it concurre with faith. But this is nothing to the purpoſe. VVe ſee in heretikes, that haue this naked and diuels faith nowe a dayes,<note place="margin">The frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes of the naked and diuels faith.</note> contempt of the Maieſtie of God, blaſphemie againſt Chriſt, diſobedience to his lawes, diſhonour to his gouernours on earth, rebellion againſt princes, ſpoyling of churches, ſacriledg of religious, ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lice againſt Catholiques, pride of heart, wantonneſſe of bodie, couetouſnes of money, with a great many ſuch of M.

But in thoſe who haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g faith clothed with charitie honour the croſſe, and are contented to haue it in their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, we ſee no ſuch ſomwhats.</p>
            <p>To ſee your folly, reaſon but this with your ſelfe M. Calf. That is better which worketh to man the leſſe harme, but the Croſſe worketh leſſe harme to man, than the diuells faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynuing ſtill a diuels faith (for it worketh none at all), ergo the croſſe in this reſpect is better than the diuels faith.

yf your poſition were true, we might make this reaſon againſt you.

The diuel was not by coniuration called vp, to hurt Iulian, but to helpe hym. etc. For Iulian had to conſulte for an empire, and thereim the diuells counſell was required. But when Iulian ſawe that terrible and oughly ſight of ſo foule a fynde, he was in greate feare, &amp; woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full agonie, and ſo vpon the ſodayne, hauing no other refuge, he made the ſigne of the Croſſe in his foreheade, as he commonly, vſed when he was a Chriſtian.

There was no cauſe why the diuell ſhould faine a feare to deceaue them. They were bothe his owne allready. <hi>Et quod ſuum eſt, amplius ſuum fieri non poteſt,</hi> ſayeth the lawe, that which is a mannes owne, can be no more his owne, than it is. There was no cauſe why he <hi>ſhould dooble a pointe.</hi> Iulian was his dearling, the coniurer his frende, and none vſe to doble with their frendes, for feare of breache of amitie. There was no cauſe why the diuell ſhould <hi>playe ſuch open playe,</hi> and runne awaye, excepte it were for feare of the ſigne of the croſſe: he was called vp by the coniurer to ſerue Iulian. Iulian was as glad to haue him as the coniurer, and the diuell would as gladlye ſerue them. There was no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of feare otherwiſe miniſtred, and yeat to runne awaye vnder pretence of feare? Howe can this ſtande? It is a great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the diuell to be rayſed vp by coniuration, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iured, the oftener is his payne encreaſed.

<pb facs="tcp:7399:105"/>
VVherfore I much maruel that you dirſt ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture to ſay, that the foreſaied ſentence of <hi>Abdias</hi> attributed to S. Iohn accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not with the doctrine of Chriſt. My ſelf will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne you of contrarying and gayneſaying the word of God, and doctrine of Chriſt in this caſe. Let your owne indifferent brothers iudge, howe litle you ſauour of any ſight in diuinitie for ſaying that thoſe wordes of <hi>Abdias</hi> accorded not with the doctrine of Chriſt. That the readers may vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d howe fouly you haue corrupted <hi>Abdias,</hi> and left out a worde, and altered his meaning, I will examine the place.</p>
            <p>He told there howe S. Iohn talking againſt riches, <hi>ſpake alſo of curing the ſicke of the palſey clenſing the lepers and caſting out of deuils,</hi> and afterward ſaied: <hi>Sed has virtutum opes habere non poſſunt, qui vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luerint diuitias habere terrenas.</hi> But they can not haue theſe powers of vertues that will haue the ryches of the worlde: VVhere the Apoſtles meaning was that they could not haue the grace and vertue of curing the ſicke, and working of miracles, who inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately deſired the riches of the earth, M. Calf. leaueth out craftelie, the worde <hi>(has)</hi> thoſe, and putteth it indefinitely, as though the Apoſtle ment, that they could haue no vertues at all, but this is playne couyn, woorſe than liegier demayne.

Let it be but a wilful ſcape, propre to heretickes.</p>
            <p>The fourth exception is this: <hi>It is more then a miracle to mee that Abdias ſhould be ſuch an auncient writer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calf. Fol 51. b mart.</note>

            <p>The fift exception is <hi>that S. Iohn allowed the fact of Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiana, whiche withdrewe her ſelf fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des company.</hi>

Yf you had loked to the ſtorie M. Calf. and conſidered the circumſtances a litle better, you would not haue called them fonde miracles, and miracles that haue no apparance of truth.

For take away firſt the authoritie of the church that alloweth the ſcripture, as heretickes haue done, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſcripture it ſelf, as in parte they doe, and there is no more reaſon why they ſhould not ſtick to call theſe miracles, that I reherſe out of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, fonde miracles, and miracles that haue no apparance of truthe, than there is why they ſhould ſay ſo of thoſe that <hi>Abdias</hi> referreth to S.

VVhere note firſt that pictures only are prohibited by this decree, and not euery picture neither, but ſuche as were painted in walles. Secondarely that this prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is but particular for pictures on walles, and being ſuch, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth not other images, but rather permitteth them: for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes prohibitorie, forbidding certaine caſes, permitte all that is

            <p>Thirdly that here is an euident proufe that pictures were then worſhipped. For this argument followeth neceſſarilie vpon thoſe wordes.

For nothing can be payncted in the walle, but the image of ſome thing. Yf M.

               <hi>Their meaſure of wheate in tyme.</hi> The place where it was made, was Eliberye or <hi>Granata</hi> a citie in Spayne, whiche at that tyme, and longe after had many infidels and Paganes, that deſpited Chriſt, and his religion: and becauſe they were idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours

them ſelues, thought the Chriſtians to committ idolatrie by hauing of images. The tyme when it was made, was when they feared perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as apeareth by the 59. and 60. Canon of the ſame cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell. The cauſe why it was made, was becauſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Chriſtians by the tyrannie of Pagans and perſecution of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels ſhould be forced to flee, and forſake their churches, they ſhould be driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to leaue their pyctures in the walles to be moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſcorned, and laughed at, by the infidells, to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte of Chriſt and ſclander of the Chriſtians. Thes circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſidred no maruell, yf ſuch Catholike biſhops deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to winne the idolatrous to the faith of Chriſt, and ſtanding in feare daily of perſecution, and knowing that yf vpon the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne they ſhoulde be forced to flee, the Pagans would pille their churches, and make their pictures left in the walles, a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king game, as they did crucifie the image of Chriſt in <hi>Berythus,</hi>

But what if thoſe fathers had no ſuch conſiderations, but did abſolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidde pictures in the church?

Doth he not remembre that when the tyme is chaunged, that which was well done before, may be chaunged according to S.

Yf he doth not, it muſt be told hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and furder ſignified, that pictures and images were not only recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into churches in diuerſe other cuntries, but alſo permitted and commaunded by general councells, as by the councel of Nice vnder Adrian the firſt, by the councell of Rome vnder Gregorie the ſecond, and the councell of Franckforde vnder Adrian in the tyme of Charlemaigne. And ſeing by theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councells the decree of that particuler Synode was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the aftercummers, according to Pope Stephens decree, and altered for the diuerſitie of tyme, as S. Auguſtine permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<pb facs="tcp:7399:111"/>
there is no reaſon why we ſhould be preſſed with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie of that Canon which was ones abrogated, and forced to preferre one prouincial Synode, before three general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, and driuen more to eſteme the order of one prouince, than the authoritie of the vniuerſall church. VVherfor M. Calf. hath by no wayes, any vantage by the Elibertine councell.</p>
            <p>Nowe as for the councell of Franckford held in the time of Charlemayn, it condemned not (as you falſlie reporte) the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth councel at Nice, but the falſe and forged Synode or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticle of heretikes aſſembled at Conſtantinople, and all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge breakers.

For as the ſouldier might fight well with his olde weapon, although he could not come to the Armarie for newe, and Galene write his boke <hi>de ſanitate tuenda,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct all that ſhould be ſycke afterward, although none were ſicke preſently: So albeit the Chriſtians were ſo perſequuted that they had no leyſure to make newe images, yet were they not ſo ſtraighted, but that they might behold the olde. And although the churches were throwe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe, and no croſſe nor Crucifixe left in them, nor Chriſtians then daring openly to worſhip them, yet might <hi>Lactantius</hi> make thoſe verſes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct other that ſhoulde come after, aſwell as thoſe that lyued preſently with him. And certes ſeing it apeareth by S. Hierome, that he had a grace in poetrie, and made other workes, <hi>carmini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Hexametris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De viris illuſtr.</note> in long verſes, as theſe are, there is more cauſe why this coniecture ſhoulde be true, than that geſſe of M.

            <p>But as <hi>Lactantius</hi> liued vnder Diocletian when Churches, were throwen downe, ſo lyued he long vnder Conſtantine, when churches were a building,<note place="margin">De viris illuſtr.

VVherefor this croſſequareller may whiſſel for a newe reaſon: for his ſecond is nothing worth.</p>
            <p>Touching the third cauſe,<note place="margin">Calf.

For he neuer taught that it was vnlaufull to bowe the knee to the ſigne of the croſſe: nor contrarie to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt to worſhip it, in ſuche ſort and manner, as the Chriſtians doe. Reade his workes ouer and ouer, and you ſhall finde no clauſe, that condemneth this religion of the Chriſtians.<note place="margin">Lacta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the vvoor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhipping of the croſſe.</note> In deede he is very vehement, and that iuſtly in his bookes <hi>De falſa religione,</hi> againſt the gentills, who worſhipped ſtockes, and ſtones, the ſunne, and mone, the earth and ſea, and dead men, and women, as <hi>Iuppiter</hi> and <hi>Iuno</hi> for Gods. Their ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, he conuinceth many waies, and proueth that God is not to be ſought for, in earthly thinges, but in heauen, as the whole chapiter alleaged doth manifeſtly declare, where it is ſaied,<note place="margin">Libro 2. cap. 19.</note> 
               <hi>who ſoeuer endeuoreth to conſider the myſtery of man and to kepe the dignitie of his nature, let him raiſe vpp him ſelf from the earth, and when his mynd is lifted vp, let him lift vp his eies to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Let him not ſeke God vnder his feete, nor plucke out of the place where he treadeth, that which he muſt adore, For what ſo euer is vnder ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, muſt of neceſsitie be inferiour to man. But God is greater than man, and therfore is aboue, and not beneath, not to be ſought, in this lowe and baſe region, but in the higheſt of all. VVherefor there is no doubt, but that there is no religion, where there is ſimulachrum.

To what purpoſe I pray you, is that fooliſh Dialogue that you make about the woordes of S. Cyprian? Is it not not all one to ſay, the authoritie of operation, geueth effect to all Sacraments in the figure of the croſſe, and the authoritie of operation in the figure of the croſſe geueth effect to all facraments? There is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in it at al. Serche wel and you ſhall finde it ſo. There are no points to diſtinct the partes of the ſentence, as you imagine. I haue conſulted diuerſe printes, and from the worde <hi>operationis</hi> they contynue it to the laſt, which is, <hi>effectum,</hi> without any point at all: and as far, as I can ſe by S. Cyprians drift in that place, thoſe woordes ſhoulde rather be gouerned of the verbe, than of any other worde that goeth before the verbe. For he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, that the vertue of the paſsion is great, by the ſigne and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the croſſe, and power that it hath, which could be to no purpoſe, yf he would haue theſe wordes <hi>in figura crucis,</hi> in the figure of the croſſe, to referred to the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of authoritie that

went before, and not to the verbe <hi>largitur effectum,</hi> that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth after.</p>
            <p>Againe where you finde fault, with your aduerſarie, for ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, and not alleaging the other wordes, that followe, it argueth that you do but quarell. For it is preſuppoſed that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian man beleaueth, that in the celebration of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the name of God is ſpeciallie to be called vpon, and that his holy name (as S.

And ſeing he tooke thoſe wordes, that made ſpeciallie for his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal purpoſe, and omitted the other as loth to be tedious in ſpeaking of that which no man denieth, no wiſe man, woulde miſlike his doing therin, nor allowe, your ſuperfluous paynes,<note place="margin">M.

            <p>Mart. VVel ſaied, I am glad that at lenght you can ſee the truth. By S. Paule then, it is playne, that we bleſſe the cuppe of benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and ſo plaine that you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not ſay, we geue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes the cupp of benediction, or we ſpeake well the cuppe of benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For that is an vnprope phraſe of ſpeache, nor yet, that we geue thankes to the cuppe of benediction. For thankes are due to God only, nor yet that we ſpeake well the cuppe of benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor geue thankes only for the cuppe of benediction. For the woordes do not import ſo much, nor imploy that ſenſe,<note place="margin">The bred and vvine bleſſed.</note> but inferre a playne bleſsing of the bread and wyne. VVhereby, yf you be one of the reaſonable creatures that your ſelf mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euen nowe, you may ſee by the woorde of God, that to bleſſe, and geue thankes, is not all one. The very places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which you alleage, proue againſt you. For when fiue lofes and two fiſhes mentioned in S. Mathewe, Marke and Luke,<note place="margin">Matt. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>

were bleſſed, it is vnpropre, to ſay, that Chriſt ſayed, well bread, wel fiſhes,<note place="margin">Marc. 6. Luc. 9.</note> or gaue thankes to the bread, and thankes to the fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hes, or for the fiſhes, but as S. Mathew ſaieth: <hi>He bleſſed and brake,</hi> what M.

Marke: <hi>Habebant paucos piſciculos &amp; ipſos benedixit,</hi> They had a fewe fiſhes and he bleſſed them.</p>
            <p>Here bleſsing is not thankes geuing, nor ſpeaking well, but a ſanctifying of thoſe creatures, a geuing a vertue and power vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to multiply, and increaſe, to ſet forth the glory of God in feeding ſo many perſons.

The lawyer ſaieth, all that is ſpoken in the preface or beginninge, is preſuppoſed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted in that which followeth. VVherfore, albeit in euery pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, I put not in all the doctours woordes, nor talke particularly of the calling vpon the name of God, yet ſeing that was: <hi>Primum in intentione,</hi> firſt in intention, as I profeſſed in my preface, and ſo well knowen of all men, that he is an heathen that doubteth of it, a charitable reader, and good Chriſtian, would euer thinke that to be pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cipally vnderſtode: but we may lerne be this, what good opinion this our good aduerſarie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaueth of vs. VVhen he preacheth, and for one halfhower ſpeaketh againſt the Pope, for another againſt the Cardinalls, for another, againſt the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities

Signes that put vs in remembrance of that which is paſt, preſent and to come, as baptiſme putteth vs in remembrance of the paſsion of Chriſt that is paſt, of preſent grace, that is remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſynnes, geuen in that ſacrament and the glorie to com, to which we haue entrie by baptiſme, this I ſay, I though, you had lerned, and could haue iudged that in this ſenſe, S. Ambroſe, S. Auguſtine, and Leo take matrimonie to be a ſacrament, and not as the woorkes of Chriſt, and parables of ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, be counted ſacraments: but I perceaue you are worſe, and worſe: eueryday more ignorant, than other. Euery ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a ſigne of an holy thing: but euery ſigne of an holy thing, is not a ſacrament. You forgett your rules of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocation. Albeit, Ariſtotle ſaied, euery horned beaſt lacketh teethe in the vpper iawe, yet you knowe right well, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer

lacketh teethe in the vpper iawe is not an horned beaſt. And ſo may you thinke of ſignes and ſacraments.</p>
            <p>But that is not the matter that you ſticke ſo much vpon. You thinke if it be a ſacrament it <hi>muſt be a ſigne, ordayned of God for vs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Calf Fol 108. a</note> 
               <hi>to confirme our faith, and ſeale the promiſe of grace within vs.</hi> This is a ſtrange definition of a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. I beſeeke you in what ſcripture,<note place="margin">Mart.</note> doctour, or councell, ſhall we finde it? Yf in none, then geue vs leaue, not to beleaue it. By this definition, we are like to haue neuer a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t left. For baptiſme was not principally ordained to confirme our faith, but to waſhe away our ſynnes, as S. Peter ſaied: Let euery one of you be baptiſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remiſsion of ſynnes.<note place="margin">Acto 2.</note> For ſuch as were of age, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that they ſhould (be confirmed in their faith, and beleaue in Chriſt before they were baptiſed, as it is written: <hi>He that beleueth and is baptiſed ſhalbe ſaued.</hi> As for infantes the faith of the church ſuffiſeth for them,<note place="margin">Marc. 16.</note> to baptiſme, to purge them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> originall ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. The ſacrament of the body and bloud of Chriſt, was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to be a meate and foode of the ſoule, in this warfare of ours, and before we can be partakers of it, we muſt not only be confirmed in faith, but alſo haue ſuch diſcretion and iudgment, which cometh not, but after certayne yeres, that we may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as S. Paule ſaieth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> to trie our ſelues, and examine our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, whether we be worthie to be partakers of that holy meate, before we preſume to come to that dreadful table of our lorde. And more ſacraments then theſe the proteſtants do not acknoweledg. So whiles M. Calf. proueth Matrimonie to be no ſacrament, by his newe deuiſed definition coyned of Caluin in <hi>Geneua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M.

            <p>Another reaſon why Matrimonie ſhould be no ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is this. <hi>VVe haue for baptiſme, who ſo euer beleaueth and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed ſhalbe ſaued: for the ſupper, Take, eate, this is my body, drincke ye all of this, this is my bloud, which is ſhed for many, for the remiſsion of ſynnes.

take a wife, and thoue ſhalt be ſaued.

Yf it may be ſhewed that it is a ſigne of inuiſible, grace,<note place="margin">Euery ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament hath not a promiſe of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſynnes annexed.

But what yf Matrimonie had ſuch a promiſe annexed vnto it, woulde this old bachiler and younge miniſter, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it to be a Sacrament?

               <hi>Is any man ſicke amongeſt you, let him bring in the prieſts of the church, and let them pray ouer him, anoynting him with oyle, in the name of God: and the praier of faith ſhall heale the ſicke, and God ſhall eaſe him, and yf he be in ſynnes, they ſhalbe forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him:</hi> yet amongeſt proteſtants they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no ſacraments.

            <p>A third reaſon they haue lerned of Caluin their brutiſh Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa vpon the wordes of S. Paule: who writing in Greke called it a myſtery and not a ſacrament. but as I anſwered in my treatiſe before, So I anſwer nowe againe, that baptiſme and the ſacrifice of the body and bloud of Chriſte, are called by diuerſe auncient fathers, myſteries, and yet notwithſtanding they be ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. For euery ſacrament is a myſterie, and this worde Sacrament and myſterie do not ſo farre differ, but that, that which is a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, may alſo be a ſacrament. Mary euery myſterie, is not a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in the propre ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: So that yf matrimonie muſt be no ſacrament, becauſe it is a myſterie, then baptiſme and the ſacrifice of the body and bloud of Chriſte be no ſacraments: for they are myſteries, and ſo we ſhall haue (as I ſaied) neuer a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb facs="tcp:7399:158"/>
left ſhortly. Such is the drift of the deuil. To this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, this quareller made no replye in the world, but thought it beſt to ſcoffe it out,<note place="margin">Fol. 109. a</note> and like a minſtrell make men laugh, <hi>with a mery mariadg ſolenniſed by the vicar of S.

            <p>The fourth reaſon why matrimonie ſhould be no ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is,<note place="margin">Fol 109 a Calf.</note> ſaieth <hi>he, becauſe it conferreth no grace. For he that is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, is not, in that reſpect more the childe of God, than yf he were vnmarried, he that is maried hath no peculier promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that for his mariage ſake, his ſynnes are remitted him: and yet theſe are requiſite in a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> For anſwer, I ſay, where I declared in my booke,<note place="margin">Mart.</note> that in matrimonie there is an inuiſible grace (that is to ſay) a gift of God, by which, they (that are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried) are made more ſtronger to ſuffer aduerſitie, more wiſer to inſtructe their children, and better able to reſiſte all corruption, and vnclenlynes, you ſhould (ſir) firſt haue diſproued theſe to be graces, and giftes of God, and than, haue ſaied, that in matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, there is no inuiſible grace, geuen to the man and wife: but that was to hard meate for your ſucking teethe.<note place="margin">Homi 20. in Geneſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, <hi>counted it a great myſterie, and vnſpeakeable wiſdom, for a man to forſake his father that begotte hym, his mother that with payne brought hym into the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Inuiſible grace ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</note> 
               <hi>and cleaue fast to a woman, which perchaunce he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſawe before:</hi> and dare you ſay it is no grace? Againe euery ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man ſo tenderly loueth his wife, as his owne fleaſh, and ioyfully contenteth him ſelf with her company, all daies of his life, and departed his body to none other. Is this no grace? Beſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des in all aduerſitie, he contynueth with her, in all ſicknes he cheriſheth her, and from all iniuries defendeth her, and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the woman for her parte to the man. Is not this a ſpeciall gift of God? Yf it be geuen in matrimonie (as none haue that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7399:158"/>
ſpecially, but thoſe that are vnited together in matrimonie) why is there no grace conferred in matrimonie?</p>
            <p>Furdermore, ſainct Paule ſaieth in this place,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> 
               <hi>that matrimonie is honorable in all thinges, and the bed vndefiled.</hi> In an other place: <hi>The womam ſhalbe ſaued by bringing foorth of children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> 
               <hi>yf they contynue in faith.</hi> Nowe yf matrimonie hath not a grace of God annexed, howe can the woman haue her ſaluation? Take away matrimo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie, the act is vncleane, vſe it in matrimonie, as God hath orday<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, it hath his reward, and why? becauſe God hath geuen it his ſpeciall grace. To be ſhort, when God ioyned our firſt parentes together, the ſcripture ſaieth, <hi>benedixit illus Deus, ac dixit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Geneſ. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Creſcite &amp; multiplicamini.</hi> God bleſſed them, and ſaied, increaſe and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie. VVhat was that? thankes geuing, prayſing or ſaying wel, according to your etimologie, M. Calf.? No: but Gods bleſsing, was a ſanctyfying of them, and geuing of a ſpirituall grace: whiche ceaſſed not in them, but flowed into all, to whome this precept of his increaſe and multiplie may extend. In S. Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we it is ſaied, <hi>whome God hath ioyned let no man ſeparate.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 19.</note> By whiche we may perrcaue that the man and wife, that come to gether in the feare of our lorde, are ioyned by God. And ſuch is his mercy, whom he ioyneth, he repleniſheth with his grace: wherbie it is euident that matrimonie hath an inuiſible grace of God annexed vnto it. But M. Calf ſaieth, he that is <hi>maried is no more the child of God in that reſpect than yf he were vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maried.</hi> It is true: what then? Is Matrimonie therfore no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? or hath it no grace annexed vnto it? It followeth not. For like as yf the Quenes Maieſtie ſhoulde geue to the lorde mayor of Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don, an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred poundes by the yere, her liberalitie ſhould be alwaies counted a ſingular fauour, and ſpeciall grace albeit in that reſpect, he be no more the Quenes ſubiect than he was before: So is matrimonie an holy ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, although the maried is not in reſpect of his marriage more the childe of God than yf he were vnmaried. For as the prince extendeth not her liberalitie to the lord Maior, to make him more her ſubiect tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was before, but to encoradge and able him, to do her grace better ſeruice, in that vocation: So God ordayned not this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb facs="tcp:7399:159"/>
of matrimonie, to make the married man more the childe of God, than, when he mas vnmaried, but to able him by his grace to liue in that ſtate honeſtly, and ſerue to the increaſe and generation of children to the honour of God, ſo long as he woulde haue men to lyue vppon the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Calf.</note>Againe to proue that matrimonye is no ſacrament M. Calf. ſaieth, <hi>he that is maried hath no peculier promiſe, that for his mariadg ſake his ſynnes are remitted, and yet theſe thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges are required in a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:</hi>

VVhere will the proteſtants proue in all ſcripture that a promiſe of remiſsion of ſynnes is annexed to this ſacrament? Yf they tell vs out of S. Iohn: <hi>Yf a man eateth of this bread, he ſhall liue for euer,</hi> we will ſay vnto them out of S. Paule: <hi>He that eateth and drinketh vnworthely, eateth and drinketh his owne iudgement not diſcerning the body of our Lord.</hi> So that remiſsion of ſynnes is not promiſed to a man, becauſe he is made partaker of this ſacrament: his ſynnes muſte be remitted before, and he him ſelf in fauour with God, before he preſume to come, to this Sacrament, otherwiſe he ſhall not only not haue remiſsion of ſynnes, but he ſhall haue a terrible iudgement alſo, and greater heape of damnation. And if there be a remiſsion of ſynnes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it a ſacrament propitiatorie,<note place="margin">M.

Yf it be not, then haue you founde a ſacrament that hath no promiſſe, of remiſsion of ſynnes annexed vnto it, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make it no ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7399:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
certes, this can be no ſacrament: and ſo of two ſacraments by this reaſon the proteſtants will leaue them ſelues but one, and not that neither, yf their definition of a ſacrament may ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, as I ſaied before.

            <p>As for S.

               <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> becauſe he ſucceded not immediatlie, after S.

A leſſer cauſe than that, will make him beleaue, as a great many proteſtantes did, and let not to put in print, that S. Peter was neuer at Rome. But what matter is it yf he do not beleaue, nor fully, nor in parte? It hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth this cauſe no more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the in credulitie of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and lacke of faith in Pilate, did hinder the veritie of Chriſts incarnation in earth, an equalitie with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heauen.

            <p>Yf M. Calf. wil not beleaue this ſaying of ſo lerned a father, Let hym beleaue the deuil hym ſelf, confeſsing the ſame.

The wicked ſprites forced by the power of God, made anſwer, againſt their will and ſaied: we were neither able to abyde, nor behold the power of Chriſt, and banner of his paſsion, which they call the croſſe. Illo enim ſigno rediuimus eneruati, etc. For we returned weakned with that ſigne, and all the princes of the ayer, and rulers of darkenes fleing away are burnt with it. Before the young man was perfitely ſigned with that ſigne, we cumming furiouſly vpon him did diſquet him. But as ſone as he had called Chriſt to his help, and armed him ſelf with the ſigne of the croſſe, he perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted vs with anger, and made vnto hym ſelf a moſt ſure defence.</hi> Here is a playne teſtimonie of the deuils, that they feare the ſigne of the croſſe, and are weakened with it, and forced to flee away at the ſight of it.

For yf the diſvſe of ſome ceremonies vſed of olde tyme for good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, doth derogate authoritie in al other from the fathers, that make mention of anye ceremonies, S.

For they made a lawe that non ſhoulde eate bluddings, or ſtyfled meate: for it is nowe gone out of vſe, no man accompte them ſelues bounde to the obſeruance of it, thought the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles all together aſſembled did make that lawe.

<pb facs="tcp:7399:172"/>
to followe it, and ſo likewiſe in the fathers. For the church hath authoritie to abrogate ceremonies and lawes, for orders and diſcipline, as the diuerſitie of tyme, place, and men require.</p>
            <p>And although one or two be altred, the reſt muſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, becauſe the church hath not ſo decreed, which prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue yf heretickes had,<note place="margin">Heretikes haue no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</note> their alteration and changing of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, had ſome colourable ſhewe of pietie, but ſeing they haue no church, no laufull biſshops, no duly called miniſtres, they ought not to alter the leſt rite, and ceremonie in Chriſtes church.

            <p>VVere it reaſon in a common ſtate of a citie, for priuate men to alter this and that ſtatute, of the whole corporation at their pleaſure?

            <p>Hitherto I haue ſpoken of the two poynts which you like an euill point maker haue knockt long to make tagleſſe, and breake a ſunder: But thankes be to God the leather was ſo good and your hammer ſo vnhamſom that they be both whole yet. Nowe let vs ſe howe you tugge at the thirde pointe: <hi>videlicet,</hi> that a croſſe was ſet vp in euery place etc. To <hi>Martialis</hi> one of the 72. diſciples that ſaied: <hi>Crucem domini in mente, in ore &amp; in ſigno tenete: Kepe the croſſe of our lorde in your mynde, in your mouth, and in a ſigne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Martialis vvorte de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nied and vvordes vvreſted. Fol. 127 a Calf.

            </p>
            <p>Here it is to be noted, howe wittely this wiſeman diſſenteth from the reſt of his brethren. For whereas they ſay, that in the ſupper we haue the body of Chriſt in a ſigne, he to haue a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ler fanſie from all the reſt, will not reſt vppon that, but ſaieth, <hi>we may haue the croſſe at the ſupper, in a ſigne, to witte the paſsion of Chriſt in bread and wyne,</hi> whiche is but a newe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed to ye, to ſhyft away an olde truth. Certaine it is that by the celebration of Chriſtes ſupper, we are put in remembraunce of Chriſtes paſsion. But becauſe it was done then, but priuilie in ſome ſecrete place, it is to be thought that the authour requiring vs to haue the croſſe of Chriſte in our myndes, in your mouthes and in a ſigne, mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that, ſeing our mature is ſo dull and heauy, that we could not alwaies thinke and ſpeake of Chriſt, vnleſſe we had ſome externall meane to excite our memory, nor be euer at the ſupper to celebrate the remembrance of his paſsion, we ſhoulde haue the ſigne of the croſſe before our eies in our churches, houſes, parlours, chambres, high waies, and els where, that whetherſoeuer we turned nor face, the croſſe might be ſee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne, and put vs in remembraunce of Chriſte. Certaine it is that <hi>Martialis</hi> was no ſignifier with Swinglius, nor meant that the ſupper of our lord is a naked ſigne. His woordes in the ſame
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7399:181"/>
epiſtle teſtifie the contrary: for he ſaieth, <hi>That whiche the Iewes through enuie ſacrificed, thinking to aboliſh his name out of the earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An aulter hallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vved. An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the preſen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
               <hi>we for our healths ſake, ſette foorth in the hallowed aulter.</hi> vpon whiche woordes we may buld this argument. That is vppon the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed aulter whiche the iewes crucified, but the iewes cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſtes true bodye, and not a naked ſigne of his bodye. <hi>Ergo</hi> his true bodie and no naked ſigne of his bodie is ſet vpon the aulter: whiche being true, it can not be, that he willing the Burdegalenſians to haue the croſſe in a ſigne, meant that they ſhoulde haue a ſigne of our lordes bodie at our lordes ſupper, but the ſigne of the croſſe in our churches, chambres, and high waies.</p>
            <p>To the place of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> that ſaied: <hi>Crucis certe figuram ex duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus lignis componentes adoramus, we certes making the figure of the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of two pieces of wood, do adore and woorſhip it,</hi> you anſwer nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, but as youe did before ſclanderouſlie reporte of me,<note place="margin">Queſt. 38. ad Antio.</note> that I fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified Tertullian: So with like impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, and leſſe honeſtie you ſay here, that I falſyfie <hi>Athanaſius.</hi>

Like wiſe the ſame Authour printed at Colonie the yere of our lorde 1548. in the printe hou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe, of Melchior Moneſiany, readeth as before, as euery man that will take paines to looke in them, may ſee, and are leſſe to be ſuſpect, of corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> than your late Baſile print. VVhiche being vndoubtedlie true, iudge (good raders) whether I alleaging <hi>Athanaſius</hi> woordes as I founde them, in three diuerſe printed bookes, haue deſerued to be accuſed for a falſifier, or he conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Yf then the croſſe which in the old lawe was a name of condemnation, and ſet as a curſed ſigne of damnation, was a material croſſe, certes the croſſe in the newe lawe, made a thing of honour, and erected in ſigne of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, muſt as S.

            <p>The croſſes that Chryſoſtome deuiſed, were (as <hi>Sozomenus</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> reporte) made of ſiluer, which argueth that they were not candelſticks, or croſſe pieces, for candles.

and then broughte into the church againe. And as the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of Paules then beganne their proceſsion in the churche, and wente into the ſtreate, ſo it is moſt likely, that the catholiques in S.

There is no mention that they repaired together to the biſshops palace, nor any one Catholiques houſe, and yeat together they came, and ſeing it is ſo, what other meter place could there be for it than the church?

            <p>By theſe places of this old father, men may knowe yf they lyſte, that neither he in al reſpectes condemned images, nor the honour geuen to ſaincts: But in that only reſpect that woemen did ſacrifice that had no authoritie at all, and that they did offer vp ſacrifice to the virgin as to God, which kinde of adoration by ſacrifice,<note place="margin">Epiphaniꝰ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that our Lady be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> is dewe to none but to God onlye. Touching the worſhip to be done to the virgin, he is wel contented that ſhe be honoured like a Martir, and her holy bodie to be honoured with prayſes. Nowe to come to the very poynt, as he wllleth al men to refrayne rayling at the virgin: Euen ſo he willeth all men to refrayne the doing of ſacrifice vnto her appartayning only to God, and forbiddeth the images that were ſet vp for that ſacrifice, or to her, as though ſhe were God. VVherevpon in the ſame place that M. Calf alleageth againſt images, he ſaieth <hi>In very dede the bodie of Marie was holy, yet for all that it was no God.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7399:242"/>
virgin, nor the angells are to be adored, nor any other mortall creature or ſeene with eie, or conceaued in heart, or expreſſed by images, yf it be aduaunced to be in degree as high as God. For it were as badde as the fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an harlot, that offreth her ſelf equally to be abuſed of many, yf any would be ſo mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de as to erect any image of a mortall creature, that the thing therby repreſented, ſhould be adored with ſacrifice as God. This is the right meaning of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> nothing againſt the ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge of Chriſt or any ſainct, as they are vſed amongeſt vs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the catholike church, as may apeare by diuerſe ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Yf the curious heretikes will ſuſpect euill, they may ſay, that men kneling in their naked churches, at the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion table, kneele, bowe, and cappe, to the bread and wyne, to the walls, to the glaſe windoes, to the formes, to the tables, to the ſunne, to the moone, and practiſe M.
